# employee_tracker

## Overview

A command line application that allows a user manage a database via several prompts. The database schema consists of an employee table, a department table and a role table. Employees can be added or removed and their roles can be updated. Departments can be viewed or added and roles can also be added. The app was built to test my ability to manipulate a SQL database after collecting user inputs.
